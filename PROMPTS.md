# Interaction History

## Prompt 1: "can you write some x86 asselmblre for a program that types the letters "hello world""
**Action Taken:**
- Created `hello.asm` with x86 assembly code that prints "hello world" using Linux system calls
- Implemented write syscall (4) to print the message
- Implemented exit syscall (1) to terminate the program

## Prompt 2: "can you create a README.md file for this code with instrcutions on how to assemble and run"
**Action Taken:**
- Created `README.md` with:
  - Prerequisites (NASM, ld, Linux environment)
  - Step-by-step assembly and running instructions
  - Program explanation
  - System calls documentation

## Prompt 3: "can you write another example that adds two floating 64-bit point numbers together"
**Action Taken:**
- Created `float_add.asm` with x86 assembly code for floating point addition
- Used x87 FPU instructions (finit, fld, fadd)
- Implemented printf for result display
- Updated README.md to include the new program

## Prompt 4: "can you create a version of the float_add program that demonstrates NVidia ptx assembler and update instructions to include that"
**Action Taken:**
- Created `float_add.ptx` with NVIDIA PTX assembly code
- Created `float_add_ptx.c` as a C wrapper for the PTX code
- Updated README.md to include:
  - PTX program information
  - Additional prerequisites (CUDA Toolkit)
  - Building and running instructions for PTX version
  - PTX-specific features explanation

## Prompt 5: "can you turn this directory into a git repository"
**Action Taken:**
- Created `.gitignore` file with appropriate rules
- Initialized Git repository with `git init`
- Added all source files to Git
- Created initial commit

## Prompt 6: "can you push the code to the brandnew, empty githun repo at git@github.com:mit-orcd/chris-assembler-for-sam-from-cursor-ai.git"
**Action Taken:**
- Added remote repository as 'origin'
- Pushed code to main branch
- Set up branch tracking

## Prompt 7: "great - can you write a file called PROMPTS.md that lists all the prompts I gave and the actions you took in response. Then update the repo and push"
**Action Taken:**
- Created this PROMPTS.md file
- Added and committed the new file
- Pushed updates to the repository
